# How do I run this files?
ofcourse these are right js files, so you can copy paste right away!

## But
there is a another way which is worth documenting,

each of these files have one line on the top
```js
#! /usr/bin/env node
```

and these files are excutable given these permissions on MacOS
```sh
chmod +x filename.js
```

## so doing this would run the file in terminal
```sh
$ ./scheduleMeeting.js
false
false
true
true
false
false
false
```
