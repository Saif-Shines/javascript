# How do I run this files?
ofcourse these are right js files, so you can copy paste right away!

## But
there is a another way which is worth documenting,

each of these files have one line on the top
```js
!# /usr/bin/env node
```

and these files are excutable given these permissions on MacOS
```sh
chmod +x filename.js
```
