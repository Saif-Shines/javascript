# Asynchronicity
Note: We recommend that after you complete a challenge, you re-comment out the test case for that challenge so the console output is not confusing when working on subsequent challenges.

## Challenge 1
Thinking point (no writing code necessary for this challenge): Inspect the code given to you in Challenge
1. In what order should the console logs come out? Howdy first or Partnah first?
